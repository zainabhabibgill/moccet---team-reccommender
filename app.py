    This app recommends teams based on how well their skills match the project's needs.

    **Here's how it works:**

    - ‚úÖ **Skill Matching**: Each team member is scored based on how many of the required skills they have.
    - üî¢ **Match Score**: We use a simple count of overlapping skills to rank members.
    - üë• **Top Picks**: The top 4 scorers are recommended for the team.
    - ‚è± **Time Forecast**: The average experience across the recommended team is used to adjust the project duration estimate.

    This is a lightweight model designed for clarity and speed. In future iterations, we could incorporate:
    - Real project history data
    - LSTM-based sequence models for forecasting
    - More complex optimization around availability and team balance
